### CP-Maker
CP-Maker is a tool that seeks to provide a hand at the time of entering a contest in codeforces.
It is common that we waste time copying the tests of our problems, also we usually spend time when uploading our problem, and it is for this reason that I have developed this tool, to save time.
So far the application has the following features:
    1. Create the template files for each of the exercises of the contest.
    2. Download the tests (input and expected output).
    3. Evaluate the tests with our outputs.
    4. Upload exercise “x” to the codeforces page.

I hope you find it useful
